# Oracle Financial Services Software (OFSS) - Financial Model & Valuation

Hello everyone,

I’ve built a comprehensive financial model for **Oracle Financial Services Software (NSE: OFSS, BSE: 532466)**, a global leader in technology and financial solutions. This model was developed to analyze the company's financial performance and gain valuable insights into its growth trajectory.



## About This Model

This model provides an in-depth financial analysis of OFSS, incorporating historical data, financial ratios, projections, and various valuation methodologies.

## This Model Includes:

1.  **Historical Financial Statements (FY15 - FY24):**
    *   In-depth analysis of Oracle's past performance, identifying key trends and patterns in the Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow.
2.  **Ratio Analysis:**
    *   Calculation of essential metrics like Return on Equity (ROE), Return on Assets (ROA), net margins, liquidity ratios, turnover ratios, and leverage ratios to evaluate financial efficiency and health.
3.  **Forecasting (FY25E - FY29E):**
    *   Projecting future financials (Sales, EBITDA, EPS) with realistic assumptions to understand potential growth trajectories.
4.  **Common-Size Statements:**
    *   Simplifying financial statements by analyzing each component as a percentage of the total (e.g., revenue or total assets), making trend comparisons easier.
5.  **WACC Calculation & Beta Regression:**
    *   Determining the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) using CAPM and peer data.
    *   Measuring systematic risk (Beta) through regression analysis against the Nifty (2-year weekly data).
6.  **Intrinsic Growth & DCF Valuation:**
    *   Estimating Oracle’s intrinsic value through Discounted Cash Flow (DCF - FCFF) analysis.
    *   Analyzing intrinsic growth potential based on ROIC and reinvestment rates.
7.  **Sensitivity & Scenario Analysis:**
    *   Assessing how changes in key assumptions (e.g., WACC, terminal growth rate) impact the DCF valuation.
    *   Ability to stress-test different financial scenarios.
8.  **Comparable Company & Football Field Analysis:**
    *   Benchmarking OFSS against industry peers using key trading multiples (EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA, P/E).
    *   Visualizing valuation ranges across multiple methods using a football field chart.
9.  **DuPont Analysis:**
    *   Decomposing Return on Equity (ROE) and Return on Assets (ROA) into their profitability, efficiency, and leverage components to pinpoint drivers of return.

## Key Data Sources & Assumptions

*   **Historical Data:** Sourced from publicly available financial reports and databases up to March 2024.
*   **Forecast Drivers:** Projections are based on historical trends, industry outlook, and specific assumptions detailed within the forecast sheets of the model.
*   **Valuation Inputs:** Critical assumptions for WACC (Risk-Free Rate, Equity Risk Premium, Beta) and DCF (Terminal Growth Rate) are clearly outlined in their respective sections.
